## What This Project Does

When the Indian monsoon underperforms, cotton supply can tighten and input costs can rise across the textile value chain.

RainLoom turns that signal into a practical early-warning system: it estimates 4-week volatility risk for key NSE textile stocks and translates those signals into actionable guidance for farmers, MSMEs, investors, and policy teams through an 8-page dashboard and AI assistant.

---

## Dashboard Pages

### Page 1: Live Risk Monitor
Real-time risk scores for 8 NSE textile stocks with per-stock glass cards showing risk level, cotton dependency, 20-day volatility, and last price. Includes rainfall deficit charts across 8 cotton states, cotton futures with regime zones, and 120-week risk evolution timelines. Live NSE market status indicator with smart next-open messaging.

### Page 2: Causal Analysis
Granger causality heatmaps, impulse response functions, lag correlation analysis, and **Instrumental Variable (IV/2SLS) analysis** using ENSO ONI as an instrument — proving monsoon→volatility causation beyond correlation. Includes first-stage F-statistics, Hausman test diagnostics, and ONI scatter plots.

### Page 3: Model Performance
ROC/AUC curves, SHAP feature importance, confusion matrices, walk-forward backtesting results, and **Adaptive Online Learning** with drift detection (Page-Hinkley, ADWIN, KS test). Model Health Monitor shows rolling performance metrics with traffic-light drift indicators.

### Page 4: Scenario Simulator
4 historical presets (Normal, 2009 Drought, 2015 Drought, El Niño) plus interactive sliders for rainfall deficit, cotton price change, VIX level, and drought spatial breadth. Shows per-stock risk predictions with confidence intervals and sensitivity sweep charts.

### Page 5: Societal Impact
Farmer advisories with district-level risk tables, crop insurance recommendations, and yield-drop estimates. MSME hedging guidance with hedge ratios and instrument suggestions. Policy recommendations with employment impact estimates and intervention triggers.

### Page 6: Hedging Backtest
Historical backtesting of hedging strategies against cotton price volatility. Evaluates hedge effectiveness using signal-triggered vs buy-and-hold approaches with quantile regression bands.

### Page 7: Geospatial Nowcast
**Live district-level rainfall map** for 83 cotton-belt districts across 10 states. Uses Open-Meteo API for real 30-day rainfall data, compared against monthly climatological normals. Plotly choropleth with diverging RdYlGn colorscale, state filters, and stressed-district summary tables. Data refreshes every 10 minutes.

### RainLoom AI Assistant
Built-in AI chat panel accessible from every page. Powered by **Groq Llama 3.1** (SLM) when API key is available, with template engine fallback. Contextual answers grounded in live dashboard data — ask about risk, monsoon status, cotton prices, or get stakeholder-specific advice.

## Design

- **Dark glass-morphism theme** — navy base (`#0f172a`), frosted card backgrounds, gradient accents
- **Inter typography** (300–800 weight) via Google Fonts
- **Plotly dark template** — transparent backgrounds, unified hover, no grid clutter
- **Responsive layout** — `max-width: 1480px` containers with CSS Grid

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **No data leakage:** `TimeSeriesSplit` everywhere — no random shuffling of time-series data
- **Causal-first:** Granger tests + IV/2SLS justify predictions before stakeholders act
- **Calibrated outputs:** Platt scaling ensures risk scores are meaningful probabilities
- **Live data:** Yahoo Finance, Open-Meteo, NOAA ENSO — no synthetic training data
- **Stakeholder-centric:** Risk scores translated to ₹/acre premiums, hedge ratios, worker counts
- **10-minute caching:** Geospatial API calls cached with TTL to avoid excessive requests

---

## Core Features (Live + Real-Time)

- **Live market monitoring:** Continuously tracks NSE textile stocks, cotton futures, and volatility with dashboard-level risk updates.
- **Real-time rainfall intelligence:** District-level rainfall nowcasting with frequent refreshes to detect emerging stress zones early.
- **Live risk scoring engine:** Ensemble model inference updates risk regimes (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH/EXTREME) from streaming inputs.
- **Real-time alerting surface:** API + dashboard + advisory panels expose current risk state for fast operational decisions.
- **Live AI assistant context:** Chat responses are grounded in the latest dashboard state, not static offline snapshots.
- **Near real-time geospatial refresh:** Open-Meteo rainfall ingestion refreshes every 10 minutes for the nowcast map.

---

## How To Further Scale RainLoom

- **Decouple ingestion from UI:** Move data collection to scheduled/background workers and let Streamlit/FastAPI read from a shared data store.
- **Add a streaming layer:** Introduce Kafka/Redpanda/PubSub for event-driven, real-time pipelines (rainfall, prices, alerts, model outputs).
- **Serve models separately:** Deploy inference as an independent microservice with autoscaling and versioned model endpoints.
- **Use online feature store patterns:** Persist low-latency, reusable features for both dashboard serving and training consistency.
- **Scale storage by workload:** Use time-series storage for tick/climate feeds and object storage for model artifacts/backtests.
- **Harden caching strategy:** Multi-tier caching (in-memory + Redis) for high-frequency reads and lower API pressure.
- **Improve reliability:** Add retries, circuit breakers, dead-letter queues, and replayable jobs for upstream API failures.
- **Expand observability:** Track latency, drift, prediction quality, and data freshness with Prometheus/Grafana + structured logs.
- **Operationalize retraining:** Automated retrain/evaluate/deploy pipelines with shadow testing and rollback-safe model releases.
- **Deploy for horizontal scale:** Container orchestration (Kubernetes/ECS) with HPA, regional failover, and blue-green deployments.
- **Secure production traffic:** API gateway, auth/rate limits, secrets management, and audit logs for enterprise-grade usage.
- **Globalize stakeholder delivery:** Webhooks, email/SMS channels, and tenant-aware alert routing for multi-organization adoption.

---
## Why This Matters In Practice

- **Causal, not just correlational:** Decisions are backed by Granger + IV/2SLS evidence, reducing false confidence from spurious market links.
- **Operationally live:** Risk, rainfall, and advisory surfaces refresh continuously, so users act on current conditions rather than stale reports.
- **Actionable for multiple stakeholders:** The same intelligence is translated into investor positioning, MSME hedging signals, farmer advisories, and policy triggers.
- **Built for reliability:** Caching, retries, and API fallbacks keep the system useful even when upstream data quality fluctuates.
- **Transparent model behavior:** SHAP, drift monitors, and calibration make model outputs explainable and auditable for high-stakes use.
- **Ready to expand:** The architecture supports stepwise growth into streaming pipelines, autoscaled inference, and enterprise integrations.

## Societal Value: Claim -> Evidence -> Outcome

| Claim | Evidence In Codebase | Practical Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Farmers get earlier risk signals before severe monsoon stress. | [5_Societal_Impact.py](./monsoon_textile_app/pages/5_Societal_Impact.py), [alerts.py](./monsoon_textile_app/utils/alerts.py) implement farmer advisory flows and district-level risk handling. | Earlier insurance and cropping decisions can reduce avoidable loss during deficit periods. |
| MSME textile operators receive procurement and hedging guidance. | [5_Societal_Impact.py](./monsoon_textile_app/pages/5_Societal_Impact.py), [advisory_engine.py](./monsoon_textile_app/components/advisory_engine.py), [alerts.py](./monsoon_textile_app/utils/alerts.py) generate MSME-specific advisory signals. | Better timing on cotton buying/hedging can reduce input-cost shocks. |
| Policy teams can monitor risk concentration and respond faster. | [5_Societal_Impact.py](./monsoon_textile_app/pages/5_Societal_Impact.py), [7_Geospatial_Nowcast.py](./monsoon_textile_app/pages/7_Geospatial_Nowcast.py) provide district/state risk visibility and policy-facing summaries. | More targeted interventions and communication during high-risk windows. |
| Decisions are grounded in causal analysis, not only correlation. | [2_Causal_Analysis.py](./monsoon_textile_app/pages/2_Causal_Analysis.py), [causal.py](./monsoon_textile_app/models/causal.py) implement Granger and IV/2SLS workflows. | Higher confidence that alerts track meaningful transmission effects. |
| The system is usable in live operations through API and alerts. | [routes.py](./monsoon_textile_app/api/routes.py), [data_bridge.py](./monsoon_textile_app/api/data_bridge.py) expose risk, alerts, and subscription endpoints. | Institutions can integrate outputs into existing monitoring and notification workflows. |

### Current Limits (Transparent)

- Estimates are decision-support signals, not guaranteed outcomes.
- Live quality depends on upstream market/weather data availability.
- Some policy and economic impact numbers are scenario-based and should be validated with field data.
